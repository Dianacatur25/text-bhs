  Health is a major problem in life. The government and various sectors are competing to create an ideal condition for public health. However, the role of the community itself is also very helpful in improving this level of health.
  
  First, people who are aware of the importance of health will help improve health levels. In addition, they will be encouraged to adopt a healthy lifestyle which will have a good impact in the long term.
  
  Then, the role of the health facilities provided is also an important factor in increasing the level of public health. The existence of adequate facilities and skilled workforce will certainly bring a significant increase.

  The role of cooperation between the government and the community itself is very much needed in improving the level of public health so that people can live comfortably and more prosperously.
